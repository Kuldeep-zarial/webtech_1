        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Brothers Restaurant was founded in 2020 by two brothers, <u>KULDEEP and NITTEN</u>, who shared a passion for cooking and a love for family. Inspired by their grandmother's traditional recipes, they wanted to create a space where people could enjoy authentic meals that bring back fond memories. Their journey started in a small kitchen, experimenting with recipes and sharing their creations with friends and family, which fueled their desire to open a restaurant.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Brothers Restaurant has grown from a small diner to a beloved local eatery known for its warm ambiance and delicious food. Each dish on our menu is crafted with love, using fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Our commitment to quality and authenticity is reflected in every plate we serve. We believe that food is not just sustenance; it's an experience that brings people together.</p>
        <p>As we continue to evolve, we remain dedicated to providing our guests with the best dining experience possible. Our team is passionate about delivering exceptional service and ensuring that every visit feels special. From casual family dinners to celebrations with friends, Brothers Restaurant is here to create unforgettable memories.</p>
